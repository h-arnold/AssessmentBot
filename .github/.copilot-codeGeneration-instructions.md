# AssessmentBot Code Schema

## Project

- TYPE: Google Apps Script assessment tool
- DOMAIN: Education, Google Classroom
- FUNCTION: Evaluate student slide submissions against references
- ASSESSMENT_CRITERIA: {Completeness, Accuracy, SPaG}
- MARKERS: {Text:"#", Images:"~|"}
- DATA_STORAGE: Google Sheets
- COMPLIANCE: GDPR (data within Google Workspace)

## Architecture

- FRONTEND: Google Apps Script
- BACKEND: [Assessment Bot Backend](https://github.com/h-arnold/AssessmentBot-Backend)
- STORAGE: Google Sheets - soon to be [JsonDBApp](https://github.com/h-arnold/JsonDbApp)

## Code_Standards

ALL NAMES: Prefer full words; avoid abbreviations unless widely recognised.

- CLASS_NAMING: PascalCase
- METHOD_NAMING: camelCase
- VARIABLE_NAMING: camelCase
- CONSTANTS: const
- VARIABLES: let
- LANGUAGE: British English
- INDENTATION: 2 spaces
- PATHS:
  - CORE: /src/frontend/BaseClassFolder
  - CONTROLLERS: /src/frontend/z_Controllers
- LOAD_ORDER: numeric prefixes (0BaseSheetManager.js)

## Implementation_Patterns

- INSTANTIATION: lazy
- DESIGN: dependency injection
- METHODS: small, focused
- SERVICES: singletons (/src/frontend/singletons.js)
- ERROR_HANDLING:
  - USER_FACING: this.progressTracker.logError(errorMessage, extraErrorDetails)
  - DEV_FACING: Use the project-wide `ABLogger` (see `src/AdminSheet/Utils/ABLogger.js`) for non-user-facing developer logs and errors. Prefer calling `ABLogger.getInstance()` (for example: `ABLogger.getInstance().debugUi(...)`) rather than `console.error` — we are gradually migrating to `ABLogger`, so all new code should use it. Do not duplicate `console.error` after `ProgressTracker.getInstance().logError`; pass extra details to `logError` as the second parameter for developer logs.
  - STRUCTURE: try/catch blocks

## Documentation

- FORMAT: JSDoc
- COMPONENTS: {description, @param, @return, @remarks}
- STYLE: British English
- INLINE: for complex logic

## Google_APIs

- SPREADSHEETS: SpreadsheetApp
- SLIDES: SlidesApp
- FILES: DriveApp
- CLASSROOM: ClassroomApp
- OPTIMIZATION: batch operations
- LIMITS: handle rate limits and quotas

## Security

- INPUT: validate all
- CALLS: minimize API usage
- PERFORMANCE: implement caching
- AUTH: verify permissions
- DATA: keep within Google Workspace
- PRIVACY: GDPR compliant

## Testing Framework (Local, Non-GAS)

- FRAMEWORK: Vitest (lightweight Jest-compatible runner)
- CONFIG: `vitest.config.js` (plain object export, avoids Vite ESM import)
- SETUP FILE: `tests/setupGlobals.js`
  - Provides shims: `Utils.generateHash`, `Utilities.base64Encode`, `Logger.log`.
  - Exposes `ArtifactFactory` globally for models referencing it indirectly.
- TEST LOCATION: `tests/**/*.test.js`
- COMMANDS:
  - Run once: `npm test` (alias for `vitest run`)
  - Watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
- SCOPE: Only pure logic / model code. Do NOT invoke Google Apps Script APIs (SlidesApp, DriveApp, etc.).
- STUBBING: If a model needs a GAS value, refactor to accept primitives or inject a stub object created inside the test.
- HASH STABILITY: Tests assume hash function is deterministic; avoid assertions on specific hash strings, only truthiness / inequality for changed content.
- ARTIFACTS: All artifact tests should use primitive content (strings, arrays, Uint8Array for images) to keep environment independent of GAS.
- SERIALISATION: Round-trip tests must use `toJSON()` / `fromJSON()` only—avoid deep cloning tricks that depend on execution context.
- NEW TESTS: When adding a new model or feature, include at least: normalisation behaviour, hashing consistency, JSON round-trip, and edge cases (empty, null, large input where applicable).
- PROHIBITED IN TESTS: Direct use of Apps Script services, network calls, timers reliant on GAS environment.
- FUTURE EXTENSION: Add coverage by installing `@vitest/coverage-v8` and running `vitest run --coverage` (not yet configured).

## Singleton loading pattern (BaseSingleton)

We centralise singleton base behaviour in a single canonical file and enforce that policy in tests and linting.

- Canonical implementation: `src/AdminSheet/00_BaseSingleton.js`
  - This file contains the complete behaviour (static `getInstance`, `_createInstance`, `resetForTests`, `_maybeFreeze`, etc.).
  - It is the single source of truth for singleton lifecycle and test helpers.

- Tests: always load the canonical base in the test bootstrap
  - To ensure unit tests use the full behaviour, require the canonical base early in `tests/setupGlobals.js`:

```javascript
// tests/setupGlobals.js
require('../src/AdminSheet/00_BaseSingleton.js');
```

- Per-file fallbacks are deprecated — do not add them
  - Do NOT add or re-introduce per-file `BaseSingleton` fallbacks inside individual singleton files (for example `ConfigurationManager` or `ProgressTracker`).
  - The previous minimal fallback pattern (defining a tiny `globalThis.BaseSingleton` in each file) is deprecated. It was originally used to avoid reference errors during isolated imports, but it increases maintenance cost and risks inconsistencies.

- How to import a singleton safely in isolation
  - If you need to require a singleton module in isolation (for a quick script or one-off test), require the canonical base first, then the singleton:

```javascript
require('../src/AdminSheet/00_BaseSingleton.js');
const ConfigurationManager = require('../src/AdminSheet/ConfigurationManager/ConfigurationManagerClass.js');
```

## Important Notes

- Only implement the code requested.
- Ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous.
- Check for existing code before creating new methods.
- Always write in British English.
- Update code with British English spelling if you find American English.
