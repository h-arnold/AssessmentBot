# 🩹 v0.7.3

## 🔧 Patch fixes & small improvements

This is a small patch release containing a few refactors, housekeeping updates and an important bugfix for text-type tasks.

- Fix: resolves an awkward regression where empty text-type template or student tasks (which are valid and expected) were being erroneously normalised. Empty text tasks are now preserved correctly and will not be treated as missing content.
- This release requires the Assessment Bot Backend version `v0.1.5` — please ensure your backend is updated before applying this release.
- Bumped internal version metadata to `0.7.3` and updated the Admin Sheet / template file IDs used for distribution (`assessmentRecordTemplateFileId` and `adminSheetFileId`).
- Refactor: Slides parsing and ProgressTracker were refactored for improved clarity and error handling.
- Refactor: task handling and error logging improvements to make failures more actionable in the UI.
- Configuration: additional configuration management, validation and user feedback improvements (including a loading overlay on the Configuration dialog).
- Misc: dependency updates, tests and minor documentation/housekeeping edits.
