# 🚀 v0.7.0

## ✨ Major Enhancements

### 🔁 New bespoke NodeJS backend (replaces Langflow)

- **Switched from Langflow to a lightweight NodeJS assessment backend** — the Langflow flows and Docker artifacts have been removed and replaced with a bespoke backend tailored to Assessment Bot.
  - Tiny fraction of Langflow’s footprint — dramatically reduced resource usage.
  - Significantly faster LLM request handling and assessment processing.
  - Improved reliability: far fewer backend build/runtime errors compared to the previous Langflow approach.
  - Easier debugging and maintainability due to simpler, purpose-built NodeJS code surface.
- **Updated request handling** to integrate with the new backend:
  - `src/AdminSheet/RequestHandlers/LLMRequestManager.js` updated to handle the new backend behaviour and error modes.
  - Better progress tracking during LLM warm-up and assessment processing.

## 🔧 Enhancements & Architecture Changes

- Fix button positioning in UpdateWizard - prevent buttons from jumping around by @Copilot in https://github.com/h-arnold/AssessmentBot/pull/51
- Tidy up SheetsManager classes by removing duplicate methods by @Copilot in https://github.com/h-arnold/AssessmentBot/pull/50
- **Front-end consolidation and module reorganization**
  - Many front-end files were moved/renamed from `src/frontend/...` to `src/AdminSheet/...` to better reflect Admin Sheet delivery and separate concerns.
  - Examples: `Assessors`, `AssignmentProcessor`, `CohortAnalysis`, `DocumentParsers`, `GoogleClassroom`, `Sheets`, `UI`, `UpdateAndInitManager`, `Utils`, and `y_controllers` were reorganised under `src/AdminSheet/`.
- **Cleaner codebase**
  - Removed Langflow-specific files and flows, simplifying the repo and reducing maintenance overhead.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes and Reliability Improvements

- **Reduced silent failures**: Removing Langflow and consolidating LLM request flows eliminates a source of intermittent failures seen when Langflow components failed to build.
- **Improved error handling**: `LLMRequestManager` updates include clearer handling of non-200 responses and better error messages logged to the existing progress/error utilities.
- **Stability improvements** across assessment runs and warm-up flows due to simplified backend interactions.

## 📚 Documentation Updates

- Updated `docs/setup/README.md` and `docs/setup/configOptions.md` to reflect:
  - Removal of Langflow deployment instructions.
  - New backend configuration notes and how to use the lightweight NodeJS backend.
- Removed outdated Langflow deployment docs:
  - `docs/setup/langflowDeployment/langflowDeployment.md` — removed
  - `docs/setup/langflowDeployment/service.yaml` — removed
- Minor updates to `.vscode/settings.json` for developer ergonomics.

## 🗂 Files added / moved / removed (high level)

- Additions / changes
  - Added: `src/AdminSheet/RequestHandlers/ImageManager.js`
  - Renamed/moved many `src/frontend/...` files to `src/AdminSheet/...` (consolidation; no functional regression intended).
  - Modified: `src/AdminSheet/RequestHandlers/LLMRequestManager.js` (major logic adjustments).

## ⬆️ Updating to v0.7.0

If you already have Assessment Bot running, update steps (high level):

1. Open your existing Admin Sheet.
2. Click **Assessment Bot** -> **Settings** -> **Update Version**.
3. Select **v0.7.0** and follow the prompts.

Notes:

- Because the backend changed from Langflow to the new NodeJS service, ensure any deployment or integration that relied on the old Langflow-based flows is updated or removed.
- If you previously used the Langflow docker/deployment docs, those steps are no longer applicable — refer to `docs/setup/README.md` for the new backend guidance.

## 🧾 Changelog summary (technical)

- 83 files changed, 638 insertions, 6929 deletions (major deletions were Langflow flows, docker and related docs).
- Front-end code reorganised into `src/AdminSheet`.
- New `ImageManager` for AdminSheet.
- `LLMRequestManager` updated to support the NodeJS backend and improved error handling.
