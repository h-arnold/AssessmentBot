# 🚀 v0.6.0

## ✨ Enhancements

### 🌈 Visual Spreadsheet Feedback

AssessmentBot now provides visual feedback directly on student spreadsheets by colour-coding cells based on formula correctness:

* **Green cells** (🟢) indicate correctly implemented formulae that match the reference task
* **Red cells** (🔴) highlight incorrect formulae that need attention
* **Yellow cells** (🟡) identify formulae that were not attempted but required in the task

This visual feedback helps students immediately identify which parts of their spreadsheet work need improvement without having to consult the assessment record separately.

### 🧰 Technical Improvements

* **BatchUpdateUtility:** Added a new utility class for executing batch update requests to Google Sheets, streamlining the update process across the application
* **SheetsFeedback Class:** Implemented a dedicated class to handle the formatting and visual feedback for student spreadsheets
* **Cell Reference Handling:** Enhanced the cell reference system to properly track and format cells based on assessment results

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **LLM Optimisation:** Prevented unnecessary LLM warm-up for spreadsheet tasks, improving performance
* **Error Logging:** Improved error handling in the `progressTracker` to ensure proper logging of issues. Caught the final calls using the old format.
* **File Archiving:** Enhanced the file archiving logic in `UpdateManager` to prevent multiple suffixes in filenames which eventually led to file copy failures.
* **Standard Casing:** Standardised casing in file references for consistency across the codebase
