# The Pedagogy Behind Assessment Bot

The goal of Assessment Bot is very simple: to **inform** teacher judgement. It doesn't feed back any information back to the students as that is for you, the teacher, to determine the best way to deliver that feedback.

This is a different approach to many other AI tools, including my own first attempt at [Assessment Bot](https://assessmentbot.com) which attempt to generate feedback for students as well. This isn't a surprise as the generation of feedback is arguably the most time consuming part of marking, and one of the least rewarding. However, prompting an LLM to generate feedback that is truly helpful to each learner is *hard*.

Here's a really simple example to to illustrate the point. Imagine that you've got a piece of work and you're only assessing for spelling punctuation and grammar. You have the following students:

- The student who rushes to complete their work and sees finishing first as a prize.
- The disengaged student who will do the bare minimum they can get away.
- A high achieving and highly anxious student terrified of failure.
- A student with dyslexia.

You would (I hope) phrase your feedback differently for each student to get the best from them. It's not practical to feed that additional context to an LLM for any number of students and so each student will get broadly similar feedback.
