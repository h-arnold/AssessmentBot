# Using the Assessor

Using the Assessor is very straightfoward. To get it to assess a piece of work you need three things:

 1. **The Slide Template**: This is the blank template you'd distribute to your students on Google Classroom.
 2. **The Reference Slides:** This is the completed version of the blank template the Slides Assessor will be comparting the students work against. It should be equivalent to what you would score a `5` for Completeness, Accuracy and SPaG (spelling, punctuation and grammar).
 3. **The students' work**: This should be the same as the blank template, but completed by your students and attached to a Google Classroom Assignment.

## Tagging

For the Assessor to know which parts of the document to assess, the relevant sections need to be 'Tagged'. At the moment, you can tag the following object types to be marked:

 - Text
 - Tables
 - Whole slide images
