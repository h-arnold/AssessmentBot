## üìã What You Need

Using Assessment Bot is straightforward. To assess a piece of work, you need three things:

1. **The Slide Template**: The blank template you distribute to your students on Google Classroom.
2. **The Reference Slides**: The completed version of the blank template that the Slides Assessment Bot will compare the students' work against. It should represent what you would score a `5` for completeness, accuracy, and SPaG (spelling, punctuation, and grammar).
3. **The Students' Work**: This should be the same as the blank template but completed by your students and attached to a Google Classroom assignment.

## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging

### Google Slides Tagging

For Assessment Bot to identify which parts of the document to assess, the relevant sections need to be "tagged." At present, the following object types can be tagged:

- Text: `#`
- Tables: `#`
- Whole Slide Images: `~`

> üí° **Tip:** Assessing whole slide images is slower and potentially less accurate than text or table-based assessments. If your task is text or table-based only, ensure you tag it accordingly.

#### üîñ How to Tag a Task for Assessment

> üí° **Tip:** Create the *Slide Template* first and tag that. Then, make a copy and add your answers to create the *Reference Slides*. This ensures tagging consistency.

##### üìù Text or Table Tasks

1. Open or create the template.
2. Select the textbox or table you want to assess.
3. Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Y` to open the formatting options.
4. Select **Alt Text**.
5. In the **Description Box**, add your tag, e.g.:
   - `# Task 1 - Fill in the gaps`
   - `# Task 2 - Meaning of life`

##### üñºÔ∏è Image Tasks

1. Open or create the template.
2. Select the image you want to assess.
3. Press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Y` to open the formatting options.
4. Select **Alt Text**.
5. In the **Description Box**, add your tag, e.g.:
   - `~ Task 1 - Complete this diagram`
   - `~ Task 2 - Sequence Block Code`

> **Note:** You can have text, table, and image tasks in the same document.

### Google Sheets Tagging

At present, there's no need to tag anything in Google Sheets. Assessment Bot currently supports the checking whether formulae in a spreadsheet are:

- Correct,
- Incorrect
- Not attempted.
  
It determines this by comparing the formulae in the *Reference Sheet* with the formulae in the *Template Sheet*. Formulae that are present in the *Reference Sheet* but not in the *Template Sheet* are identified as tasks to assess. This means that any formulae you put in the template for scaffolding purposes will not be assessed.

## üì§ Distributing Tasks to Your Students

Attach the *Slide Template* to your Google Classroom assignment as normal.

## üîç Assessing Student Work

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

If you have followed the process above, you should have:

1. **A Slide Template**: The blank template for students to complete.
2. **Reference Slides**: A completed version of the *Slide Template* that would score a `5` for completeness, accuracy, and SPaG.
3. **A Google Classroom Assignment**: The *Slide Template* attached for students to complete.

> **Note:** Ensure students have completed at least part of the task before proceeding.

If you are missing any of these components, go back and complete them first.

### üÜî Getting the Slide IDs

You need the *Reference Slides* and *Slide Template* IDs to assess the work. To get these:

1. Open each document.
2. Select the part of the URL after `/d/` and before `/edit`.
   - For example: `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/THIS_BIT_IS_THE_SLIDE_ID/edit#slide=id.g2addc53a3a4_0_188`
3. Copy that part of the string.

> üí° **Tip:** You only need to do this once for assignments with the same name. Encourage everyone in the department to name assignments consistently.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** While this process is finicky, implementing a GUI method would require access to the `PickerAPI`, which is blocked for most educational accounts.

### ‚öôÔ∏è The Assessment Process

1. Open the Assessment Record Google Sheet for the class you want to assess.
2. Click **Assessment Bot** from the menu at the top of the screen.
3. Click **Assess Student Work**.
4. Select the assignment you want to assess and click **Go**.
5. Enter the Slide IDs for the *Reference Slides* (top) and *Template* (bottom) [which you obtained earlier](#-getting-the-slide-ids) and click **Go**.
6. Wait patiently. The assessment can take 2 to 10 minutes depending on the document's size and complexity. Image tasks take significantly longer than text or table tasks.
7. Once complete, you will have a RAG-coloured table summarising all the students' work.
